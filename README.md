# Create A Token

## Description

This solidity program is a token contract that enables the minting, and  burning of tokens as well as tracks individual token balances for addresses. It provides simple implementation for managing and manipulating tokens within a decentralized application. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. 

To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., myToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file to start creating the token contract:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here

    // mapping variable here

    // mint function

    // burn function

}
